# Graphql

**What is GraphQL?**

GraphQL is a query language for your API and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine but is backed by your existing code and data.

A GraphQL service is created by defining types and fields on those types, then providing functions for each field on each type.&#x20;

**My definition**

Graphql is a type of conversation between server and client based on an HTTP request that uses POST to communicate with the type schema defined in the server on by default create a contract of data transfer between server and client.&#x20;
