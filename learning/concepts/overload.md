# Overload

Overloading permits different methods with the same name but differing signatures in a class. The signature comprises the number of parameters, their data type, and the order in which they are passed in the method. Because method overloading occurs at build time, it is referred to as compile-time polymorphism. Overloading methods in a class is done to improve program readability so that the programmer may create an improved implementation of any function for various contexts.
